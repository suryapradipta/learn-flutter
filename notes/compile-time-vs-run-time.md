Compile Time
- compile is where you take the program that you're writing here and tell the computer that I want you to package this up, so that i can run it later on x and y machine. So the process of packaging things up simply said is compile or compilation. This is from where you start your program with hands until you package it (compile)

Run Time
- However, when you run it like we're runnign it at the moment on iOS simulator that session where you start outputting your program in this device and for it to run your program from that moment. then the distinction separates into runtime.
